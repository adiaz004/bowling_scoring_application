ABOUT

The app allows you to track your score during a bowling game.
It supports a normal 10 Frame game with added bonuses if you score
a spare or stike.

Strike: A strike earns 10 points plus the sum of your next two shots.
Spare: A spare earns 10 points plus the sum of your next one shot.
Open Frame: An open frame only earns the number of pins knocked down.
10th Frame: if you roll a stike in the first shot of the 10th frame, you get
    two more shots.


DEVELOPMENT

This app is written in QT follows a view-controller model. This means that the
bowling game should be easily ported to some other UI framework as the game logic
all lives in the bowlinggamemanger.cpp file.

BUILDING
I've included a binary that was built for 64-bit windows 10 in the BUILD directory,
however if you'd like to build it for your platform then you'll need to download and install QT
and setup a build profile for your platform.

RUN
BUILD\standalone_release\BowlingScoringApplication.exe
